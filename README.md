# Corporate Sales Simulation Project
Welcome to the Corporate Sales Simulation project! This repository contains a Python-based simulation designed to emulate a corporation with a randomized inventory of products and brands across multiple stores. The simulation generates customer purchase data, analyzes it, and provides insights into buying patterns, store performance, and product popularity
# Features
Simulation Setup
Inventory Initialization: Randomly generates a diverse inventory of products and brands with varying prices.
Customer Purchases: Simulates 500 customer transactions across 200 stores.
Data Output: Creates both a CSV file and a Pandas DataFrame for detailed analysis and manipulation.
Analytical Capabilities
Product Prevalence: Identifies the most frequently purchased products across all transactions.
Large Basket Frequency: Analyzes how often customers make large purchases (large baskets).
Large Basket Buyer Stores: Pinpoints which stores attract the most large-basket buyers and quantifies their impact.
Top Stores Visualization: Ranks the top-performing stores by frequency of large-basket buyers using a visual chart.
Top-N Products: Lists the most popular products among large-basket buyers.
Categorical Basket Analysis: Explores the average categorical makeup of large-basket buyers' purchases and formulates a visualization for this data.
Frequent Item Pairs: Identifies the most commonly purchased pairs of items across all stores.
Top Store Items: Highlights the most frequently purchased items at stores with the highest sales totals.
