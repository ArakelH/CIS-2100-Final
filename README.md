# Corporate Sales Simulation Project

Welcome to the **Corporate Sales Simulation** project! This repository contains a Python-based simulation designed to emulate a corporation with a randomized inventory of products and brands across multiple stores. The simulation generates customer purchase data, analyzes it, and provides insights into buying patterns, store performance, and product popularity.

## Features

### Simulation Setup
- **Inventory Initialization**: Randomly generates a diverse inventory of products and brands with varying prices.
- **Customer Purchases**: Simulates 500 customer transactions across 200 stores.
- **Data Output**: Creates both a CSV file and a Pandas DataFrame for detailed analysis and manipulation.

### Analytical Capabilities
1. **Product Prevalence**: Identifies the most frequently purchased products across all transactions.
2. **Large Basket Frequency**: Analyzes how often customers make large purchases (large baskets).
3. **Large Basket Buyer Stores**: Pinpoints which stores attract the most large-basket buyers and quantifies their impact.
4. **Top Stores Visualization**: Ranks the top-performing stores by frequency of large-basket buyers using a visual chart.
5. **Top-N Products**: Lists the most popular products among large-basket buyers.
6. **Categorical Basket Analysis**: Explores the average categorical makeup of large-basket buyers' purchases and formulates a visualization for this data.
7. **Frequent Item Pairs**: Identifies the most commonly purchased pairs of items across all stores.
8. **Top Store Items**: Highlights the most frequently purchased items at stores with the highest sales totals.
